**The Janus Project: Empowering Parents in the Digital Age**

---

## Mission Statement

### Our Mission
To empower parents with simple, affordable tools that give children safe access to technology while maintaining complete parental oversight—without subscriptions, without complexity, and without compromise.

### Our Vision
A world where every parent can confidently give their child a learning device, knowing they have complete control—using devices they already own, at a price that doesn't break the family budget.

### Our Values

**1. Parents First**  
Every decision starts with: "Does this serve parents and protect children?" Not shareholders, not advertisers, not data brokers.

**2. Privacy as a Right**  
Children's data isn't a product to be sold. We comply with the strictest privacy laws (COPPA, GDPR-K, PIPEDA) because it's right.

**3. Transparency Always**  
No hidden fees. No surprise subscriptions. No selling your data. What you see is what you get.

**4. Accessibility for All**  
Technology shouldn't be a luxury. If you have an old Android phone, you have the hardware. We provide the software.

**5. Simplicity Without Sacrifice**  
Powerful controls shouldn't require technical expertise. If you can use a smartphone, you can use Janus.

## The Extended Origin Story

### Spring 2024: The Problem

Sarah Mitchell was exhausted from daily battles with her children (ages 7 and 9) over screen time and device access.

She'd tried everything:
- Scheduled screen time → timer meltdowns
- "Earn your device time" charts → too complicated
- Sharing family tablet → constant fighting
- Cheap tablets → flooded with ads and inappropriate content

### The Research Phase

Three weeks of obsessive research. Spreadsheets. Facebook groups. Hundreds of Amazon reviews.

**What she found:**

**Option 1: Kids' Tablets**
- Amazon Fire Kids: \-210 each
- Locked to Amazon ecosystem
- Monthly subscriptions for content
- Budget impact: \ + \/year

**Option 2: Parental Control Apps**
- Qustodio, Bark, Net Nanny: \-20/month
- Required internet connection
- Kids found workarounds
- Budget impact: \-240/year, forever

**Option 3: Google Family Link**
- Free but complicated
- Didn't work offline
- Purchases still slipped through
- Required Google accounts for kids under 13

**Option 4: Apple Screen Time**
- Great... if you had \+ per device
- Kids discovered workarounds
- Budget impact: \+ per child

**The common thread:** Too expensive, too complicated, or didn't actually solve the problem.

### The Breakthrough

While cleaning the kitchen junk drawer, Sarah found two old Android phones—a Samsung Galaxy S7 and Motorola G6. Both functional. Both unused for 2+ years.

Combined retail value when new: \,200.  
Current value: Collecting dust.

**The question that changed everything:**

"What if I could turn these into safe learning devices my kids would actually enjoy?"

### The Prototype

Sarah experimented:
1. Factory reset the Samsung
2. Installed only parent-approved apps (Khan Academy Kids, Epic! reading)
3. Disabled Google Play Store completely
4. Removed browsers and social media
5. Set WiFi-only mode (no cell service)
6. Put it in a cute case Emma picked out

**The result:**  
Emma was thrilled. She had her "own phone." But it was:
- ✓ 100% offline-capable
- ✓ No in-app purchases possible
- ✓ Age-appropriate content only
- ✓ Educational focus with fun rewards

Sarah could check usage remotely. Emma stopped asking for a "real phone" because she had one.

### The Tipping Point

Sarah shared her solution at school pickup.

Within 24 hours, her phone was buzzing:
- "Can you help me set this up?"
- "Where did you get that app?"
- "This is genius!"

Over three months, Sarah helped **47 families**. Each time, she refined the process. The feedback was unanimous:

> "This is exactly what I needed and couldn't find anywhere."

### The Decision

After the 47th family, Sarah decided: "I need to turn this into a real product."

Not a blog post. A real app that any parent could use—no technical skills required.

It needed to be:
- ✓ DIY (no company controlling your device)
- ✓ No-code (no technical skills)
- ✓ One-time purchase (no subscriptions)
- ✓ Offline-first (work anywhere)
- ✓ Privacy-focused (COPPA/GDPR from day one)
- ✓ Actually effective (system-level controls)

She named it **Janus**—the Roman god with two faces. One watching over. One exploring forward.

## The Janus Approach

### What Makes Janus Different

**1. Offline-First Philosophy**  
Your child should be able to read, learn, and create anywhere—car, grandma's house, plane. All core features work perfectly offline.

**2. Prevention, Not Monitoring**  
We don't surveil children. We create safe environments. Janus prevents problems before they happen.

**3. Repurpose, Don't Replace**  
That old Android phone isn't e-waste. It's a learning device waiting to happen.

**4. No Subscriptions Ever**  
One-time purchase. Own it forever. All features included.

**5. Kid-Friendly Design**  
Your child shouldn't feel punished. The interface is colorful, encouraging, and makes them feel like they have their "own" device—because they do.

## How Janus Works (Non-Technical)

### Two Apps in One

**The Parent App (on YOUR phone):**
- Dashboard showing all connected devices
- App library for approvals
- Usage reports
- Real-time alerts
- Simple controls (time limits, filters)

**The Child App (on THEIR device):**
- Simplified home screen with approved apps only
- Colorful, fun interface
- "Ask Parent" button for requests
- Educational mode indicators
- Full offline functionality

**The Magic:**  
Janus operates at system level. This means:
- No app store access without approval
- No in-app purchase buttons exist
- Can't uninstall without parent password
- All controls work offline
