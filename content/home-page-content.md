## The Story: One Parent's Challenge

### The Tuesday Morning That Changed Everything

It was a Tuesday morning in spring 2024 when Sarah Mitchell realized she'd had the same argument with her 8-year-old daughter three times that week—and it was only Tuesday.

"But Mom, *everyone* has a phone!" Emma pleaded, her eyes welling with tears. "I'm the only one in my class without one!"

Sarah knew this wasn't entirely true, but she also understood the feeling. Her daughter was growing up in a different world. A world where being "connected" started younger and younger.

That evening, Sarah found herself scrolling through parenting forums at 11 PM, reading the same frustrations echoed by hundreds of other parents:

> *"My 7-year-old keeps asking for a tablet, but I'm terrified of what he might access online."*

> *"I want to give my kids some independence, but I need to know they're safe."*

> *"Why do all the parental control apps require monthly subscriptions AND new devices?"*

> *"My daughter accidentally spent \ on in-app purchases last month."*

The solutions available were expensive, complicated, or simply didn't work.

### The Lightbulb Moment

While cleaning out a kitchen drawer, Sarah found two old Android phones—devices that had been replaced but were still perfectly functional.

That's when it hit her: **What if she could transform these forgotten devices into safe, parent-controlled learning tools?**

She started researching. Could she:
- ✅ Block ALL purchases without her approval?
- ✅ Control exactly which apps could be installed?
- ✅ Monitor usage without being invasive?
- ✅ Make educational apps work offline?
- ✅ Do all this WITHOUT a cell phone plan?

The answer from existing solutions was: *"Sort of, but it's complicated."*

### From Frustration to Solution

Sarah spent three weeks testing every parental control app, kids' tablet, and screen time solution on the market.

**The \+ Problem:** Kids' tablets cost \-300 per device.

**The Monthly Fee Trap:** Parental control apps charge \-20/month forever.

**The Technical Nightmare:** Most solutions require technical expertise.

**The Purchase Loophole:** Even with controls, kids find ways to trigger in-app purchases.

**The Online Dependency:** Most features require constant internet.

### The Birth of Janus

Sarah named her solution **"Janus"** after the Roman god with two faces—one watching over, one exploring forward.

Within two weeks, Emma had her "own phone" loaded with reading apps, math games, creative tools, and age-appropriate games.

**What it DIDN'T have:**
- ❌ No internet browser
- ❌ No social media
- ❌ No YouTube
- ❌ No in-app purchases
- ❌ No way to download apps without Mom's approval

Emma felt like a "big kid." Sarah felt at peace.

### The Movement Begins

Word spread quickly. At soccer practice, school events, neighborhood groups—parents were desperate for this solution.

Within three months, Sarah had helped 47 families. The pattern was clear: **Parents everywhere needed this.**

### Today

Janus is preparing for **beta launch in June 2026**, with hundreds of families already on the waitlist.

**The mission:** Help parents navigate the digital age without losing their minds—or their wallets.
