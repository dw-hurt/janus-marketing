## Our Pricing Philosophy

### What We Believe

**1. You shouldn't pay forever for software you own.**  
Subscriptions are great for services that require ongoing infrastructure (like streaming). But parental control software? That should be yours to keep.

**2. Families have budgets.**  
We're parents too. We know \/month adds up to \/year, \ over 5 years. That's absurd.

**3. All features should be included.**  
No "premium" tiers. No "pro" versions. No locked features. You get everything.

**4. Transparency matters.**  
No hidden fees. No surprise charges. No "free trial" that auto-renews. What you see is what you pay.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Pricing

**Q: Why not just make it free?**  
A: We need to sustain development, security audits, compliance certifications, and customer support. "Free" products often make money by selling your data. We never will. Fair pricing keeps us honest.

**Q: Can I switch from annual to one-time?**  
A: Yes! Email us. We'll credit your previous payments toward one-time purchase.

**Q: What if I only have 1 child? Can I pay less?**  
A: Not at launch. All plans include up to 3 devices because families grow and you might have guests (niece/nephew visiting). It's future-proofed.

**Q: Do grandparents/co-parents need separate accounts?**  
A: No! Unlimited parent devices included. Share access with anyone you trust.

**Q: What happens if I don't pay for annual renewal?**  
A: Your app continues working! You just won't get new features or updates after your year expires. Re-subscribe anytime to get caught up.

### About Value

**Q: Why is this better than free options like Google Family Link?**  
A: Janus gives true system-level control, works offline, doesn't require child Google accounts, and actually blocks in-app purchases instead of just notifying you.

**Q: Is it worth it vs. just being more vigilant?**  
A: Can you watch your child 24/7? Janus gives you peace of mind when you're cooking dinner, working, or sleeping. It's an extra set of eyes that never blinks.

**Q: What if my kid outgrows it in 2 years?**  
A: Perfect! If you buy the one-time license, you spent less than 6 months of Qustodio. And you can reuse it for younger siblings or pass devices to cousins.

- ✓ **Family harmony** (fewer arguments about screen time)
