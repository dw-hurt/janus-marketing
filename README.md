# Janus Marketing Website

Marketing website and content for **Janus** parental control app beta launch.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Janus** is a DIY, no-code parental control solution that transforms old Android phones into safe, monitored learning devices for non-teenage children without requiring cell service.

Named after the Roman god with two faces, Janus represents the dual perspective of parental oversight and childhood independence.
